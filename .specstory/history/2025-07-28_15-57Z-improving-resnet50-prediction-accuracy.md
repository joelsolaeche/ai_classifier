# Improving ResNet50 prediction accuracy (2025-07-28 15:57Z)

_**User**_

resnet50 is failing to give predictions even for an apple, what could be the reasons and how can i improve its accuracy?

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you investigate why ResNet50 is failing to give predictions for an apple. Let's first check how the model is implemented and used in your project.

Let's look at the test file to understand what's expected from the model:

---

Read file: model/tests/test_model.py

---

Let's also check the Redis configuration and settings:

---

Read file: model/settings.py

---

Let's also check the ml_service.py file since there appears to be an issue with the Redis URL:

---

Read file: model/ml_service.py

---

Let's also check the API service:

---

Read file: api/app/model/services.py

---

Let's check the router to see how images are processed:

---

Read file: api/app/model/router.py

---

Let's check the utils file to see how files are processed:

---

Read file: api/app/utils.py
